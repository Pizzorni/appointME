This is a scalable scheduling web application. It is meant to be used by universities to schedule advisor meetings with students. Currently we support student registration and booking/viewing appointments. This is written in Python and HTML, using Django as a web server, with mySQL to store data, and memcached to store sessions as well as some parts of some web templates.
